## I'd like to add an event

If you are in an R-Govy group, such as the Inter-agency R Users Group, contact the group organizers to find out who posts events to that calendar. Both public events and events limited to your R-Govy group can be posted. Only members will see the latter.

If you are not part of an R-Govy group and want to add an event, <a href = "mailto: rgovys@gmail.com">send an email</a>.

## I am not seeing events that I think I should

To see calendar events that are specific to a particular R-Govy group, you need to be invited to that calendar. Some events are only for certain groups (not open to the public). So first step is to contact the R-Govy group that you expect to see events for. Where do I find that? Ask around in your agency or you can <a href = "mailto: rgovys@gmail.com">send an email</a> and we might be able to point you in the right direction.
