  [Website](https://rverse-tutorials.github.io/RWorkflow-NWFSC-2021/) 1-hour workshops on Fridays in June and July 2021. Workshops on GitHub and R packages geared towards NOAA scientists and common work tasks, however material is applicable to scientists in general. The live WebEx sessions are restricted to NOAA staff (or anyone with `.noaa` email) due to WebEx limitations. However all material is public and online, including the recorded live sessions.
