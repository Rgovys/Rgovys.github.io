[NASA announced](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/openscapes) a 3-year [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) program to support training in in the tools for modern data science using open science workflows within the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs). "Researchers are often tasked with analyzing large datasets, but they rarely have formal training in coding, data wrangling, and collaborative research practices. Compounding these challenges is the need to migrate data analyses to the cloud as remote sensing instruments provide higher resolution data." The training has a heavy emphasis on R and Python, which are mainstays of open science computing and statistical analysis.
